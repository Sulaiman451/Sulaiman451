I'm Sulaiman, currently an ICT Apprentice employed by a prestigious university. My first months of this were spent in the service desk, and I have recently started my rotation in the Cloud Platforms team. Prior to this, I became interested in a tech career after dabbling in some coding for front-end purposes since the first lockdown.
